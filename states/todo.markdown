* Potential energy
    * Show field in 2D
    * Rolling ball instead of line
	* Two different kinds of particles
        * attractive adn
		* Positive and negative
* Arranges neatly when still
* The attraction is negligible when moving
	* Demonstrate this with only two (maybe three) particles first
* To think about:
    * Why do the particles arrange in a certain way?
        * LJ: hexagonal
        * coulomb: rectangular
        * reciprocal LJ: some kinda combination?
